# CSS-Portfolio

## Description

In this challenge I had the opportunity to work from the starter code provided by EDX teachers. However I had to build up this Portfolio website on my own. I enjoyed working on this project because I learnt a lot on how to use CSS to style my page and how to create grids.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

Once the page is loaded, you can use the links in the navbar and it will navigate you to the relevant field.
